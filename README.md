# E-Football

E-version of our childhood game hand-football

Rules of game:

Game starts with the player with the ball.

Player and CPU input a number between 1/2/3, if the number of the player and CPU matches, the ball switches between player and CPU, whoever had the ball, loses it to other.

If player and CPU input different number, this counts as one successful pass, making 4 consecutive passes gives the player a scoring chance.

In the scoring chance, the player has to input between 4/5/6. If the player and the CPU input different number, the goal is scored, else the goal is blocked and the game continues to the passing stage.

Whoever scores the first goal wins.
